# slides2

This is my reinvention of the wheel. The wheel beeing: Some way to create browser-based presentations in simple text-files. I am using clojurescript for that.

I did not care for fancy slide transitions, as I do not need them at all.

If you are looking for something more fancy, feature complete and stable, you could have a look at impress.js or reveal.js respectively.

## Usage

I did not put this to a repo like clojars yet, so for the moment you have to start with a ```lein install```.

Then use [slides2-lein-template](https://github.com/stammi/slides2-lein-template/) to create a sceleton presentation. See README over there.
